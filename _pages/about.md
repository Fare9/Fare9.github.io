My name is Eduardo Blázquez but people commonly know me as Fare9. I am a Java compiler engineer at Quarkslab and I am finishing a PhD in Computer Science at UC3M. My research has been focused on the Android ecosystem security and privacy, but right now I enjoy writing tools for static binary analysis and also learning more about Compiler's internals. I have worked at UC3M's COSEC lab as Research assistant, as Reverse Engineer at ReversingLabs, and as Malware Analyst in Panda Security. I obtained my Computer Engineering degree at University of Alcalá de Henares (UAH), and later I obtained a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M). Mostly I focus on learning about LLVM framework, C++ programming and Java obfuscation, but I also enjoy doing reverse engineering and coding in other languages (C, Python, even assembly). I hope people enjoy the content of this website as much as I had fun writing it.

## Hobbies

When I'm not in front of my laptop, I enjoy playing video games, reading manga, or watching anime. Martial arts are also my passion, and I've obtained a 1st Dan Black Belt in Ninjutsu Jinsoku Ryu. Additionally, I hold a 5 Khan in Thai Boxing by the FIMT. Currently, I'm practicing the Karate Goju Ryu style.

I really love various Asian cultures, but my main interest is on Japanese culture since a young age. I frequently listen to music from China, Korea, or Japan (I've included a list at the bottom of this page). Occasionally, I try cooking Japanese cuisine at home. Currently, I'm dedicated to learning the Japanese language and hold a JLPT Noken 5 certification.

Other hobbies I enjoy include hiking with friends and watching films or series.
