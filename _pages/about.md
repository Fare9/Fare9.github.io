My name is Eduardo Blázquez but people commonly knows me as Fare9. I'm research assistant and PhD student at UC3M's Computer Security Lab (COSEC), my research has been focused on the Android ecosystem security and privacy, but right now I enjoy writing tools for static (binary) analysis and I'm learning more about Compiler's internals. Before joining COSEC lab I worked as Reverse Engineer at ReversingLabs, and as Malware Analyst in Panda Security. I got my Computer Degree at University of Alcalá de Henares (UAH), and later a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M). As I said I'm learning about Compiler's internals, and I'm trying to focus on the LLVM framework, I also enjoy doing reverse engineering and I like coding on different programming languages. Right now I mostly program in C++, and do some data analysis in Python, but I also enjoy coding in C and assembly.

## Hobbies

When I'm not in front of my laptop I like playing videogames, reading manga or watching anime. 

I like martial arts, I have a 1st Dan Black Belt on Ninjutsu Jinsoku Ryu, and also I have a 5 Khan in Thai Boxing by the FIMT. Right now I practice Karate Goju Ryu style.

I really like different Asian cultures, but I fell in love with Japanese culture when I was very young, so commonly I'm listening Chinese, Korean or Japanese music at the laboratory (I leave a list at the bottom of this page). From time to time I also cook Japanese food at home, and currently I'm learning Japanese Language (right now I hold JLPT Noken 5).
