## Slides of my PhD Presentation

Here you can find the slides from my PhD presentation, the presentation included a few animations that have been expanded using a plugin for LibreOffice [ExpandAnimations Plugin](https://github.com/monperrus/ExpandAnimations).

My PhD research focuses on various aspects of Security and Privacy within the Android Operating System. The presentation is based primarily on the four main chapters of the thesis. The first chapter explores Android updates through the software known as FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air). The second chapter analyzes the different mechanisms available in Android for app installations, as well as research conducted to identify the types of apps installed on user devices. The third chapter introduces Kunai, a static analysis library we developed for Dalvik and APK files. Finally, the fourth chapter covers the world of Android obfuscation, where we analyzed the use of different software protectors, using APKiD as our tool for identifying them.
