## Abstract

In this survey, we try to summarise modern malware classification methods and analysis tools, and give an insight into the current research efforts that are used to build state-of-the-art malware classification systems that are used to detect the most dangerous malware families built for the operating system, Microsoft Windows. Before diving into automatic classification methods and features (malware indicators) used, we describe the accompanying analysis approaches that are the fundamental building block of every automatic classifier. This paper has the intention to summarise and categorise various efforts of researches that emerged in the last years and recognise upcoming challenges in the vibrant malware landscape.
